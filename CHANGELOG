*v1.0.3* (2009-11-24)
* Added support for delayed writing (to reduce DOM manipulation time) - optional boolean third param on embedCSS() and newStyleElement() now allow delayed writing to the document (true by default, use false to disable)
* Added support for custom @ rules
* Added the tests for extended at rules
* Adjusted extract to work with old IE versions and their horribly disfiguring of embedded CSS (fixes Greg Lucas' bug)
* Double-checked the examples for functionality under delayed-write
* More optimization for file size and performance
  - Externalized more strings and object references
  - Streamlined the addRules method to allow for bulk writing
  - Aliased recurring checks
* adjusted the pages test to check that overloading is working properly
* Updated title of combined example
* Fixed some bugs in the tests
* Updated the cache test to bail if being run locally (to avoid throwing a Security Error in Firefox)

*v1.0* (2009-09-08)

* added support for local cache when server (not file) based
* added public method eCSStender::disableCache to disable caching
* overhauled the caching mechanisms to be faster and more broad
* added new public method eCSStender::ignore() which accepts a string filename or array of string filenames to ignore when parsing stylesheets (allows speeding up by excluding simple stylesheets)
* added public method eCSStender::onComplete() which accepts functions to be run when eCSStender finishes its work (for extensions that require access to everything after the fact)
* eCSStender::setFilter() renamed eCSStender::addMethod() to avoid confusion with "filters" as a means of weeding out results of a search
* eCSStender.filters renamed eCSStender.methods to avoid confusion with "filters" as a means of weeding out results of a search
* updated & added to unit tests & examples
* added JS code for QUnit to the package
* moved project from private repository to Github

*v0.10* (2009-06-08)

* overhaul of numerous internals to speed things up
* opened up selector-based lookups to finding by Function, either as a single or in an array
* added a new method (eCSStender::lookup) to enable extension to re-query the CSS to extract additional information form the stylesheet. It takes arguments similar to those of eCSStender::register and returns an array of matches with a full complement of details. See the source for more information
* continued implementing the CSS3 selectors module, including a fix for IE6's issues with compound class selectors and a re-factoring of the nth-child extension to allow for some browsers' failure to comprehend whitespace not to require inline style additions.
* added/updated test cases

--
*v0.9* (2009-06-05)

* overhaul of internal eCSStend() method to speed it up
* opened up selector-based lookups to finding by RegExp
* adjusted eCSStender::register() to accept an array of selector lookups, each item of which can be a selector string (including compound selector strings) or RegExp.
* began work on implementing CSS3 modular extensions (./extensions/css3-modules), starting with selectors (./extensions/css3-modules/selectors) which leverage Sizzle (http://sizzlejs.com/)

--

*v0.7* (2009-05-15)

* adjusted the findImportedStyleSheets() method to better support IE6
* extracted the code to add a new stylesheet to the stack into a new private method: addStyleSheet()

* added support for filtering the results of a lookup by property or property value; new private method filtersMatched() and an example implemented in the transform test (see below)
* adjusted the handling of the __xhr property to better deal with IE6
* added a private method called zero_out() to assist in auto-converting all instances of "0px" to "0" in properties (to ensure consistency when comparing native storage or properties)
* adjusted eCSStender::addRules() for better cross-browser compatibility
* fixed a bug in eCSStender::isSupported() where IE was reporting that it knew what to do with advanced properties like “transform” (it didn't)
* added a new test: ./tests/transform.html that implements CSS rotation in IE5.5+, Mozilla 3.5, and Safari 4
